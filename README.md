# UltrasonicSorting
Code for 4DOF arm to sort packages based on size

Used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to determine the box size using distance measured from sensor to the box and used positional coordinates from forward and inverse kinematics to automatically maneuver the robot arm to pick and drop the boxes into their respective sized bins.
